        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, I wish to get a broader understanding of web development,
              including front end development.
            </li>
            <li>Second, I feel like javascript is a huge hole in my programming experience,
            and so I wish to fill it in.</li>
            <li>Third, I wanted to fill the last spot of my schedule with a class that is a little
            more fun and creative than my other classes...</li>
          </ol>

        <h2>Prior Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Most of my experience with web development is using the LAMP/WAMP stack.
          I programmed an interactive web app with nothing but HTML,CSS, and PHP.
          Although the app looked pretty good and functioned well, I realized that javascript
          would have made the experience much better and easier.
