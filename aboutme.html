        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Noah Roberson, and im a senior at CSUF. Im studying Computer Science and will be
          graduating this semester (Spring 2019) with a BS degree. This website is part of the course work
          for the front end development course: CPSC 349. Besides all this, here are some of my interests:
          <ul>
            <li>I enjoy gaming on PC and PS4 (big surprise for a comp sci major...)</li>
            <li>Im also into 3d art and graphics using Maya, zbrush, and blender.</li>
            <li>Also unsurprisingly I enjoy programming personal projects in C# and C++ in my spare time.</li>
            <li>I spend way too much time watching Youtube and visiting Reddit</li>
          </ul>
